MRI Processing
=================

Tools
---------------

 - For DWI and T1 processing we used `Tractoflow`_ .
 - For DWI processing we used `NODDI Flow`_ and `Freewater Flow`_ .
 - For ihMT processing we used `ihMT Flow`_

   Process and analysis overview. Various tools available in Scilpy are used to process 3DT1, DWI and ihMT images.Tractoflow is used to process T1 and DWI images to generate tractograms and maps of diffusion measurements derived from the DTI and fODF model. Tractoflow outputs are used for Freewater flow to correct DWI and generate freewater-corrected measurement maps derived from the DTI model and the freewater map. Similarly, NODDI flow is used to generate the 4 microstructure maps calculated using the Amico model. In parallel, ihMT images are processed with ihMT flow to generate the 4 myelin maps (2 ratios and 2 saturations, i.e. corrected for T1 dependence). From the tractogram generated by Tractoflow, the white matter bundles are segmented using RecoBundlesX.Finally, from each bundle and the diffusion and myelin measurement maps, the mean value for the whole bundle and along the bundle are obtained using Tractometry flow.


Bundles segmentation
--------------------

For the segmentation of bundles we used `RecobundlesX Flow`_ .

   Representation of the major white matter bundle models used by RecobundlesX as shape priors to extract the bundles from the whole tractogram. Bundles of both hemispheres are shown. The Arcuate fasciculus is in dark green, the cingulum in yellow, the inferior fronto-orbital fasciculus in orange, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus in ligh green, the optic radiation in blue-green, the uncinate fasciculus in dark purple, the corticospinal tract in dark blue, the superior longitudinal fasciculus parts in purple gradation, the corpus callosum is represented in several color ranges.


Quality Control
---------------
The visual quality assessment procedure was applied to the main steps according to the following criteria (using `DMRI QC Flow`_):
