Welcome to the SCIL multimodal MRI longitudinal database
==========================================================

The SCIL longitudinal multimodal MRI database is a single-center, repeated-measure study that collects
multimodal MRI data with a high number of acquisitions over a short period of time in healthy subjects.
This dataset includes :

    * anatomical image (3DT1)
    * multi-shell diffusion weighted images (DWI)
    * inhomogeneous MT images (ihMT - MTI)

This site provides a description of the average values for MRI measurements that can be generated by the tools developed by the Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging Lab (`SCIL`_)

SCIL tools
-----------------

The SCIL tools are open-source here: `scilpy`_.
Full documentation, including installation, a description of the scilpy tools and pipelines can be found `SCIL documentation`_.

Tools used for images processing are listed below and available on `SCIL github`_ :

   - `Tractoflow`_
   - `NODDI flow`_
   - `Freewater flow`_
   - `ihMT flow`_
   - `DMRI QC Flow`_
   - `RBX flow`_
   - `Tractometry flow`_
