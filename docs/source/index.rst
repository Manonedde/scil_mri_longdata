Welcome to the High-frequency MRI database documentation
=========================================================

The SCIL longitudinal multimodal MRI database is a single-center, repeated-measures study that collects
multimodal MRI data with a high number of acquisitions over a short period of time in healthy subjects.

The tools described and used are developed by the Sherbrooke Connectivity Imaging Lab, `SCIL <https://github.com/scilus>`__.
